<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- the <!DOCTYPE html> main tag is to set up the file to be read as an html file. This format is designed purely for presentation of content, no interaction or stylistic qualities -->

<html>
  <!--html tag is the first needed to set up our page. The html tag acts as a container, containing all of the code and information that will be displayed on the page. -->

  <head>
    <!-- the head tag acts as a header outside the content of the page. This is where certain attributes of style can be added, meta data to allow the page to be searchable and further properties of the page itself. -->

    <title>Glitcht art</title>
    <!-- title tag is placed in the header and changes the pages title, which can be viewable in the web browser tab. -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- After the header you have the main body of the page, hence the name of the tag. This is where text, images, links, and information to be viewed are entered here. Similar to the head container, you can add customized styles in each individual tag. -->

    <a href="index.html">HOME</a>
    <!-- <a> tag is a link. To make the link go to another pag, you need the href attribute. Enter the url, or file name that you want to direct the link to. This can be an image, mp3, or whatever file you have in your main directory. -->
    <br />
    <!-- the <br> tag is a line break. This immediately adds a line break in your text. This can be used as a nice spacer for content, links, etc. -->

    <!--Headings -->

    <!-- h1,h2,etc are tags for headers of a page. Think like a bold title. -->

    


    <h2>
      Images
    </h2>
    <!-- To embed an image you can do it multiple ways, either by entering a url address in the href attribute, or by linking to a file using the directory address -->
